## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
homes<-read_csv("C:\\Users\\dfels\\Downloads\\train.csv")
head(homes)
homes.is_na()
```

## Including Plots
```{r}
lm_lasso_spec <- 
  linear_reg() %>%
  set_args(mixture = 1, penalty = 0) %>% ## mixture = 1 indicates Lasso, we'll talk about penalty later
  set_engine(engine = 'glmnet') %>%
  set_mode('regression') 

lasso_spec <- 
  linear_reg() %>%
  set_args(mixture = 1, penalty = 1) %>% ## mixture = 1 indicates Lasso, we'll talk about penalty later
  set_engine(engine = 'glmnet') %>%
  set_mode('regression')
```

```{r}
drop_cols=c("misc_feature","alley","lot_frontage","garage_yr_blt","garage_type")
homes_new=select(homes,-c("MiscFeature","Alley","LotFrontage","GarageYrBlt","GarageType","Fence","PoolQC","FireplaceQu","MasVnrArea"))
homes_new=select(homes,c("MSSubClass","SalePrice","GarageQual","BsmtFinType2","LotArea","Street","LotShape","LandContour","OverallQual","OverallCond","YearBuilt","TotRmsAbvGrd"))
#homes_new=replace_na(homes_new,0)
print(map(homes_new, ~sum(is.na(.))))
#homes_new$GarageQual






homes_rec <- recipe( SalePrice ~ . , data = homes_new) %>%
  #update_role(Id, new_role = "Id") %>% # we don't want to use ID as predictor
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>% 
  step_nzv(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_unknown(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors()) # important step for LASSO

#homes_new$GarageQual

homes_new[is.na(homes_new)] = 'NoAv'

#homes_new$GarageQual



homes_rec %>%
  prep(training=homes_new) %>%
  bake(new_data=NULL)

print(map(homes_rec, ~sum(is.na(.))))

lasso_wf_Homes <- workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(homes_rec) %>%
  add_model(lm_lasso_spec) 

lasso_fit_Homes <- lasso_wf_Homes %>% 
  fit(data = homes_new) # Fit to entire data set (for now)

tidy(lasso_fit_Homes) # penalty = 0; equivalent to lm

plot(lasso_fit_Homes %>% extract_fit_parsnip() %>% pluck('fit'), # way to get the original glmnet output
     xvar = "lambda") # glmnet fits the model with a variety of lambda penalty values


```

You can also embed plots, for example:
```{r}
data_cv10 <- vfold_cv(homes_new, v = 10)

# Lasso Model Spec with tune
lm_lasso_spec_tune <- 
  linear_reg() %>%
  set_args(mixture = 1, penalty = tune()) %>% ## mixture = 1 indicates Lasso
  set_engine(engine = 'glmnet') %>% #note we are using a different engine
  set_mode('regression') 

# Workflow (Recipe + Model)
lasso_wf_tune <- workflow() %>% 
  add_recipe(homes_rec) %>%
  add_model(lm_lasso_spec_tune) 

# Tune Model (trying a variety of values of Lambda penalty)
penalty_grid <- grid_regular(
  penalty(range = c(0, 10)), #log10 transformed 10^-5 to 10^3
  levels = 30)

tune_res <- tune_grid( # new function for tuning parameters
  lasso_wf_tune, # workflow
  resamples = data_cv10, # cv folds
  metrics = metric_set(rmse, mae),
  grid = penalty_grid # penalty grid defined above
)

# Visualize Model Evaluation Metrics from Tuning
autoplot(tune_res) + theme_classic()

# Summarize Model Evaluation Metrics (CV)
collect_metrics(tune_res,summarize=TRUE) %>%
  filter(.metric == 'rmse' || .metric=='mae') %>% # or choose mae
  select(penalty, rmse = mean,std_err) 

best_penalty <- select_best(tune_res, metric = 'rmse') # choose penalty value based on lowest mae or rmse

# Fit Final Model
final_wf <- finalize_workflow(lasso_wf_tune, best_penalty) # incorporates penalty value to workflow

final_fit <- fit(final_wf, data = homes_new)

tidy(final_fit)

lasso_mod_out <- final_fit %>%
    predict(new_data = homes_new) %>%
    bind_cols(homes_new) %>%
    mutate(resid = SalePrice - .pred)


ggplot(lasso_mod_out,aes(y=abs(resid),x=YearBuilt))+geom_point()

```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Reflection:

I really greatly appreciate all the work that you're doing to lighten the load on us. It's been a succession of
difficult semesters, so everything you do means a lot. The in class work is clear and explains the material well,
and the book is usually good, though it often goes a little over my head in the more in depth sections. If there 
is any one area I probably need more help in, it's usually in miscellaneous R work like filling in NA values,
or finding out where they exist. I should probably know this more in depth by now, but R is somewhat different from
other programming languages, and I feel like I have a difficult time remembering the relative basics.
